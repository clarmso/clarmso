* AI: ChatGPT for writing, Github Co-pilot for coding
* Past tech stack: Cypress, Selenium, CircleCI, Docker, Javascript, Node/NPM, React.js, Elastic & Kibana
* Work-related bragging rights: I convinced one of my past teams to fuzz the input fields by a donut emoji on a staging environment. (No production system has been harmed.)
