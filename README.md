### 👋🏼 Hello! I am Clare!
* Currently working on: Tooling and Infrastructure, Test Automation for Firefox iOS
* Current tech stack: Github Actions, Bitrise, Swift, Python, pytest, Google Cloud, macOS, Linux
* Past tech stack: Cypress, Selenium, CircleCI, Docker, Javascript, Node/NPM, React.js, Elastic & Kibana
* Work-related bragging rights: I convinced one of my past teams to fuzz the input fields by a donut emoji on a staging environment. (No production system has been harmed.)
* Non work-related bragging rights: I was a piano accompanist and a skilled chorister.
